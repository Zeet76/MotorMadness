Hello, thanks for purchasing the asset!

_______________________________________

To get the same look as in video, screenshots and rigged car for quick play, please download the unitypackage from the link down below:

http://bit.ly/DSV1_2b (for unity 2017 versions)

http://bit.ly/DSV12019 (for unity 2019.1 & above)


Before you Import, please install "postprocessing package" from package manager(This is very important) and switch the project to LINEAR COLOR SPACE from GAMMA.

Once that is done, Import the unitypackage, open the Track01 - demo scene! Now you should've  rigged Car and post processing effects in the scene. 

Let the real time lighting get auto-generated. (might take sometime, depending upon your system).

You should have the scene looking excatly like in the screenshots.


If you have any trouble setting up the scene, please contact me.

Regarding the Skybox material you seen in key images on the DS track's Store Page:

The skybox can be downloaded free from http://noemotionhdrs.net/hdrday.html (05-18_Day_F.hdr is the one I used). 

You can use it for both personal and commercial work,licenced under "creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International".

Please check their Webstie FAQ for more information.

HighEnd Platform Tips:

Please use the LINEAR COLOR SPACE and Deferred Lighting  for better results.

Bake Lightmap and occlusion culling in the scene before play.

Custom vertex colors shader was used to create skidmarks on the track. However, if you wish to have clean track, you can just switch to standard shader. 

While the main priority of this asset is environment, It felt empty without the characters in it. 
And it takes good amount of time to create high quality characters(Modelling, rigging, retopology, Uv mapping, texturing, animations).
So for now, I've added few "beta pitcrew models", which are eventually be replaced with high quality character models. 
Stay close to forum thread, where I post the progress.


Mobile Platform Tips:

Please use your own carphysics. Unitycar isn't really optimised for mobile, it's just for demo.

Use your own shaders for the mobile track. Mobile track has some custom shaders that are not really optimised for the mobile, Sorry, I'm not a shader artist.

If you do want car shadows on mobile platform, Use something like Dynamic Blob shadows. They are cheap and efficent compared to realtime shadows in unity.

Don't use procedural skybox on mobile, it's expensive.

I will be adding the audience for the mobile track in the upcoming updates.
